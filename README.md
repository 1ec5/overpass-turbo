overpass turbo
==============

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tyrasd/overpass-ide.png)](https://travis-ci.org/tyrasd/overpass-ide)

This is a GUI for testing and developing queries for the [Overpass-API](http://www.overpass-api.de/). It can also used for simple analysis of OSM data.

INSTALL
-------

This application runs out of the box (no special installation needed)!

If you want to make turbo accessible to other people, you can put it on a web-server, for example.

RUN
---

To run overpass turbo, just open index.html in a modern web browser. Recent versions of Chrome, Firefox and Opera have been tested and should work.

You will probably have to be online while using turbo (unless you are running a local instance of the overpass-api).
