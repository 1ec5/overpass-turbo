overpass turbo
==============

This is a GUI for testing and developing queries for the [Overpass-API](http://www.overpass-api.de/). It can also used for simple analysis of OSM data.

INSTALL
-------

This application runs out of the box (no special installation needed)!

If you want to make the ide accessible to other people, you can put it on a web-server, for example.

RUN
---

To run the ide, just open index.html in a modern web browser. Recent versions of Chrome, Firefox and Opera have been tested and should work.

You will probably have to be online while using the ide (unless you are running a local instance of the overpass-api).
